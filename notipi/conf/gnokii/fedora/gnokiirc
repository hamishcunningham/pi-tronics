# Copy this file into $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnokii/config (which is

# model settings following the comments below.  See
# http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Config for working examples.
#

[global]

# Set port to the physical port used to connect to your phone.
# port = none

# Then using phone connected to the serial port (not USB) you should
# use (for Linux):
# port = /dev/ttyS0
#
# For MacOSX you will need something like:
# port = /dev/cu.USA28X1P1.1
#
# FreeBSD (probably NetBSD and OpenBSD too) use:
# port = /dev/cuaa0
#
# With Linux-IrDA you will want to use
# port = /dev/ircomm0
# or similiar.
#
# Use this setting also for the Bluetooth connection:
# port = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
# when using it with AT driver set it to:
# port = /dev/rfcomm0
# or similiar.
#
# For the Linux USB cables you will need one of the following settings (or
# similiar)
# port = /dev/ttyUSB0
# port = /dev/tts/USB0
# port = /dev/ttyACM0
# the last one will work only with AT driver. The correct setting should be
# given in the dmesg output.
#
# If you use connection type dku2libusb use it to denote which use endpoint
# you'd wish to use. It is useful when you have more than one phone connected
# to your computer using DKU2 cable. Numbering goes from 1 upwards.
# Default is 1.
port = 1
#
# If you use connection type phonet use it to denote the network device to use.
# See README-6510 for more details.
# port = usbpn0

# Change it according to instructions
model = series40
# Set model to the model number of your phone. For the
# Symbian phones use:
# model = symbian
#
# For other non-Nokia phones and when you want to use AT
# mode use:
# model = AT
#
# If you can't figure out what to put here read the FAQ.
# If it still doesn't help, consult gnokii-ml or #gnokii at freenode.
# For Nokia phones (non-Symbian), most likely you'll need:
# model = 6510
# There are few main models that when chosen should make use of the
# appropriate drivers. These are: 6110, 7110, 6510, 3110, 2110, 6160.

# Set IrDA device name.
# If you use irda connection you may want gnokii to autodetect the irda
# device it connects to. This is fine for most of the cases. if you have
# more than one device in range you may want to give manually the device
# name so gnokii correctly recognizes it. Use the name that you can see
# in the discovery log when the phone with infrared is in the range of
# your irda port.
# Note that you need to set this for each phone_ section separately. It
# isn't nested from the global section.
# irda_string = Nokia 6610i

# Initlength controls the number of characters sent to the
# phone during initialisation.  You can either set it to
# the word "default" or a positive integer.
#
# You can try setting this value if you want to connect
# to the phone quicker.  If you've never noticed the
# connection to be slow, it is suggested that you
# leave this alone.  Read the initialisation code in fbus-xxxx
# to understand what this changes if you're curious.
initlength = default

# Most USB cables for Nokia phones should work with the libusb driver
# (recommended)
connection = dku2libusb
# and with the new kernel driver (Linux 2.6.28+)
# connection = phonet
# If you have 6210/6250/7110 phone and dau9p cable (the one you can
# use with 6100 series and cannot use hardware modem from the phone)
# you may want to use 'dau9p' value to get faster initialization.
# If you use dlr3 or dlr3p cable for nokia phones in FBUS mode (ie.
# you don't use model = AT) you may want to use 'dlr3p' value here.
# Note that it is recommended and currently the best way to use this
# cable with nk6510 driver.
# connection = serial
# With DKU-2 cable use the following setting with the now unsupported Linux
# kernel driver that was provided with older libgnokii versions:
# connection = dku2
# With DKU-5 cable use the following setting
# connection = dku5
# For Bluetooth and AT driver use the following setting
# connection = serial
# For other Bluetooth settings use
# connection = bluetooth
# For infrared connection with phones other than Nokia 6110/6130/6150 use:
# connection = irda
# Don't forget to run: 'irattach irda0 -s' or similiar before running gnokii
# For the nk6110 driver only connection=infrared is valid for IrDA.
# See Docs/gnokii-ir-howto for more detailes on this.
# For connection with a PC/SC compatible Smart Card reader use:
# connection = pcsc

# Set this to 'yes' if you want gnokii to set and check the lock file in
# /var/lock directory. It avoids potential conflicts with other serial
# port software (eg. minicom). If you have wrong permissions for the
# directory, a warning will be generated. If you don't want a lockfile, set
# it to 'no'.
use_locking = no

# Baudrate to use on serial port connections.
# Currently used only by models AT and BIP/CIMD. Defaults to 19200.

# on opening the serial port:
# > Serial device: opening device /dev/ttyACM0
serial_baudrate = 19200

# Force waiting after each sent character the specified usec time.
# Value -1 forces the fastest 'block' writing,
# value 0 writes each character separately without any explicit waiting,
# other positive values specify the appropriate 1/1000000 sec delaying.
# Siemens M20 requires at least "1"!  FIXME: Model-driven autodetection

# Force serial port handshaking mode, useful primarily for "AT" model.
# Gnokii "AT" model uses software handshake by default.
# Possible values: hardware (RTS/CTS - 7 wires) or software (XON/XOFF - 3 wires)
#handshake = software

# If defined (not commented out by '#') it will quit Gnokii anytime
# when DCD line will drop.
#require_dcd = 1

# If set to 0, DTR and RTS will not be set on the serial line. Default is 1.

# If you are using a bluetooth connection, you can specify the rfcomm
# channel number here. If you don't specify the value, it is autodetected
# on connection (it may take an additional second). FBUS connections always
# ignore this value and use channel 14.
#rfcomm_channel = 1

# There may happen various timeouts during the communication with the phone.
# This parameter enables the retransmission policy. Ie. if the phone doesn't
# respond, we send the frame again. This happened mainly with the older
# phones. You may want to enable it when you see mysterious timeouts.
# Be very careful with this option. It is suspected to cause phone breakage
# with new DCT4 phones (like Nokia 6100). By default it is switched off
# (sm_retry = 0)
#sm_retry = 1

# Run the specified script(s) right after opening and initializing the device
# and before any communication (right before closing for disconnect_script).

# If your Nokia phone isn't correctly handled by libgnokii you can describe
# its features with a comma separated list of flags (and please write to the
# mailing list so it can be fixed).
# For phones older than Series 40 use OLD_DEFAULT; for Series 40 3rd Edition
# and later Series 40 use DEFAULT_S40_3RD; for all other Nokias use DEFAULT.
# Format is: product name=model name[,flag]...
# where product name is the corresponding string returned by gnokii --identify
# model name is the marketing name of the phone and valid flags are:
# AUTHENTICATION: phone needs a special protocol initialization
# CALENDAR: phone supports calendar events (first protocol)
# CALLERGROUP: phone supports caller groups in phonebooks
# DATA: phone supports an old non-AT protocol for data communications (DON'T use this)
# DEFAULT_S40_3RD: shortcut for DEFAULT, SMSFILE, EXTPBK2, EXTCALENDAR
# DEFAULT: shortcut for OLD_DEFAULT, CALLERGROUP, EXTPBK, FOLDERS
# DTMF: phone can send DTMF tones
# EXTCALENDAR: phone supports calendar events (second protocol)
# EXTPBK: phonebooks supports more than just name and number (first protocol)
# EXTPBK2: phonebooks supports more than just name and number (second protocol)
# FOLDERS: SMS are stored in IN, OU, ... instead of SM, ME
# FULLPBK: currently unused
# KEYBOARD: keypresses can be emulated by the computer
# NETMONITOR: phone supports Nokia NetMonitor
# OLD_DEFAULT: shortcut for SPEEDDIAL, SMS, DTMF, KEYBOARD, CALENDAR
# SMSFILE: SMS are stored in the phone's filesystem
# SMS: phone supports SMS
# SPEEDDIAL: phone supports speed dials
# XGNOKIIBREAKAGE: enable dangerous functions known to damage some phones (DON'T use this)
